# #Ô∏è‚É£Introduction
Welcome to the **students Performance analysis** where we interprete the data of the **Students performance dataset** in order to discover patterns and ways in which students are able to achieve good grades and high scores. We'll search for correlations between features as well as other relationships that will help us achieve our goal. In this project we'll of course handle missing values, sort out the biases in the data and normalize skewed distrubutions (if any)

-------------------------
## üéØProject goal
Investigate patterns as to how and why students are able to achieve good performance based on certain features like hours of study or sleep, attendance, class participation, extracurriculars and so on.

-------------------------
## üìäAnalysis
Here we'll analyse, clean, visualize and draw insightful conclusions on the data, in our analysis we'll sort out the various biases that come with the data like how the `Grade` column doesn't refleact the academic performance of a student and so on.

-------------------------
## üíæData
This dataset is real data of 5,000 records collected from a private learning provider.
The dataset includes key attributes necessary for exploring patterns, correlations, and insights related to academic performance. Dataset contains some missing values, bias in some features and imbalanced distribution.

## ü§îQuestions:
- What factors contribute most to high student performance?
- Does family background influence academic success?
- How does gender relate to scores?
- Do extracurricular activities impact grades?
- Do stress levels negatively impact academic performance?
- Are students with more sleep performing better?
- Is the any **significant** difference in the average scores of various departments?
